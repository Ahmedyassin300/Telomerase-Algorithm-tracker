# Telomerase-Tracker Algorithm

*TelomereTracker* is a Python-based Algorithm designed to analyze telomere lengths in plant sequences. It uses sequence alignment and motif counting to estimate telomere lengths and provides visualization of the results.

## Features:
- Load and preprocess sequence data from FASTA files.
- Align sequences using MUSCLE or similar tools.
- Estimate telomere lengths based on specified motifs.
- Visualize telomere length distributions using histograms.

## Prerequisites:
- *Python 3.x*: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
- *Biopython*: For handling biological sequences.
- *Matplotlib*: For creating visualizations.
- *MUSCLE*: For sequence alignment (or an alternative alignment tool).

## Installation

### 1. Install Python Libraries

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

bash
pip install biopython matplotlib

### 2. Install MUSCLE
Download and install MUSCLE from [MUSCLE's official website]
(http://www.drive5.com/muscle/downloads.htm). 
Ensure that the MUSCLE executable is accessible from your system's PATH.

## Usage
1. *Prepare Your Sequence Data*:
Create a FASTA file containing the sequences you want to analyze,
Ensure the file is formatted correctly.

2. *Update the Script*: Modify the file_path and aligned_output_path variables in the script to point to your input and output files.

3. *Run the Script*: Execute the script to process the sequences, perform alignment, estimate telomere lengths, and generate visualizations.

### Example
Assume you have a FASTA file named example_sequences.fasta with the following content:
>sequence1
TTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG

>sequence2
ATCGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGATCG

>sequence3
TTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG

>sequence4
ATCGATCGATCG

>sequence5
TTAGGGTTAGGG

Save this as example_sequences.fasta and use the following command to run the script:
bash
python telomere_tracker.py

### Algorithm Configuration
Update the following variables in telomere_tracker.py:
- file_path: Path to your input FASTA file.
- aligned_output_path: Path to save the aligned sequences.

## Notes
- Ensure MUSCLE or your chosen alignment tool is correctly installed and accessible.
- Modify script parameters as needed to fit your specific dataset and requirements.
- For large datasets, consider optimizing sequence alignment and processing steps.
